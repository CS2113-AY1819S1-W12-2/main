== Introduction

NSync is a program for NUS students who *strive to keep their lives organised, despite their busy schedules*.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`main 3` : deletes contact whose index number is 3
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Items with `1..`​ after them can be used multiple times, excluding zero times e.g. `[ENROLLED MODULE]1..`
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== General Commands


==== Listing entered commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order. +
Format: `history`

[NOTE]
====
* Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
* For privacy reasons, `downloadAllNotes` and `downloadSelectNotes` commands will not be saved to history.  This is because
those commands contain the user's IVLE password.
====


==== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

==== Saving the data

Address book data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +

Format: `help`

==== Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the address book +
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...[em/ENROLLED MODULE]...`

[TIP]
If you somehow lose your self contact, you can create a new one by adding t/self to your add command. Adding any
other tag will not have any effect on the contact created.

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 em/CS2113T`

image::SampleTimeTable.png[width="800"]
Figure 1: Sample time-table

Example 1: `free f/self` +
Running this command will show your next available time-slot (from current time). +
With reference to Figure 1 above, if the current day and time is Monday 3:00pm, your next available time-slot shown is Monday 4:00pm till 8:00pm. If the current day and time is Monday 4:34pm, your next available time-slot shown is Monday 4:34pm till 8:00pm.

// end::freecommand[]

// tag::exportcommand[]
==== Export user data: `export`
Met a new acquaintence who would like to have your contact details and time-table to schedule a common meeting time? `export` allows you to export all of a user's (or your own) details in each respective field into an encoded string. (Once you have sent the string to another NSync user, he/she can use `import` to retrieve the data within the encoded string - see `import` for more details) +
Format: `export PUBLIC/PRIVATE SELF/INDEX`

****
* Type 'public' if you would like the user who imports your contact to see the full contents of your time-table.
* Type 'private' if you would like the user who imports your contact to see only your free and busy time-slots respectively (i.e. specific contents of your time-table are hidden!).
****

All examples shown below are with reference to the sample time-table shown in Figure 1 above.

Example 1: `export public self` +
The importing user will see your time-table in its entirety (i.e. the full contents of the time-table), exactly as shown in Figure 1 above.

Example 2: `export private self` +
The importing user will see only the busy and free time-slots in your time-table, marked as black and white colored slots respectively, as seen in Figure 2 below.

image::ExportPrivateView.png[width="800"]
Figure 2: What the user who imports will see (private view)

[TIP]
The generated string from the command will be automatically copied for you (no manual selecting and copying required)! All you have to do is to send it in its entirety to a fellow NSync user who will import it.

[NOTE]
When exporting a time-table with only free and busy time-slots (i.e. black and white slots), it does not matter if you select either the public or private option - the user who imports your generated string will see the same time-table.

[NOTE]
Exporting more than 1 user's details at a time or exporting a merged time-table is currently not available (but will be implemented in future releases!).
// end::exportcommand[]

// tag::importcommand[]
==== Import user data: `import`

Did you receive an encoded string from a fellow NSync user? Use `import` to transfer all of the data within the string into your copy of NSync! +
Format: `import [PASTE_YOUR_ENCODED_STRING_HERE]`

Display Message 1: Import Successful! +
If you have imported a valid contact who is currently not in your NSync (i.e. no contact with the same name), all of the imported user's details will now be found in your NSync.

[NOTE]
If you see only black and white colored slots in the time-table of the imported contact, it means that the exporting user could have chosen the `private` option during the `export` process. See `export` for more details.

Display Message 2: Import Successful! An existing contact has been found in NSync and has been overwritten. +
If you have imported a valid contact who is currently already in your NSync (i.e. contact with the same name), all of the details found in the imported string will overwrite the existing ones found in your NSync, for that particular contact.

[TIP]
If you have unintentionally over-written the details of an existing contact, use `undo` to get back the original details of the contact!

Display Message 3: Import Failed! +
If you have missed out a character, or accidentally modified one of the characters in the string, attempting to import the invalid string will result in an error displayed. Please obtain a valid string from the contact who passed it to you.
