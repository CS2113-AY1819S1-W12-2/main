By: `Team W12-2`      Since: `Aug 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiDeveloperGuide.PNG[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, `MergedTimetablePanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract
`UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::modelDeveloperGuide.PNG[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"] +
 +
Similarly, we can store a `EnrolledModules` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `EnrolledModules` object per unique `EnrolledModules`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `EnrolledModules` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassEvenBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::changetimeslot[]
=== Change Time Slot Feature
==== Current Implementation
The change time slot feature allows users to edit the timetables of the contacts in their address book. The user
inputs the index of the contact whose timetable they would like to edit, the day and time of the time slot they want
to edit, and the activity they would like to put in that time slot.

Given below is an example a usage scenario and how the change mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs the index, day, time and activity. `The ChangeTimeSlotCommandParser` puts them into an array
`activities` and checks to ensure that all the inputs are present and the inputs are in the correct format. Any
incorrectly formatted input will result in a `ParseException` being thrown. It then calls the `ChangeTimeSlotCommand`
 with the first element of `activities` as the `index` and `activities` as arguments.

image::ChangeTimeslot1.PNG[width="400",align="center"gra]

Step 2. The `ChangeTimeSlotCommand` uses the index to get the `Person`, `personToChange` whose timetable is supposed to
be changed. It then calls `createNewUpdatedTimetable` with the timetable of `personToChange` copy of their timetable is
made. This method iterates through `activities` and gets the day time and
activity by checking their position in the array. The time slot to be changed is retrieved based on the selected `Person`, day and time.
It then checks to see if the activity at the selected time slot is the same as the one it is supposed to be changed to. If it is, it is
ignored. If it is not, the time slot in the copied timetable is changed and a Boolean variable `didTimetableChange` is
set to true.

image::ChangeTimeslot2.PNG[width="500",align="center"]

Step 3. Once `activities` has been fully iterated through, a new `Person` `newPerson` is created with all the same
identity fields of `personToChange`, except for the timetable which is the changed timetable.

image::ChangeTimeslot3.PNG[width="500",align="center"]

Step 4. `newPerson` replaces `personToChange` in the `AddressBook`.

image::ChangeTimeslot4.PNG[width="400",align="center"]

The following sequence diagram shows how the `change` function works.

image::ChangeTimeslot5.PNG[width="500",align="center"]


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How change executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a copy of the timetable to change and then create a new `Person` with
the same identity fields as the `person` to change with the changed timetable and replacing the `person` to change with
this new `Person`.
** Pros: Prevents a bugs caused by user inputting the same change to a time slot twice in the same input which
results in the application stating that no time slot was changed even though a time slot is changed.
** Cons: Takes more processes making it a little slower.
* **Alternative 2 :** Directly change the timetable of the `person` to change.
** Pros: Takes less processes making it a little faster.
** Cons: Might result in aforementioned bug.
// end::changetimeslot[]


// tag::mergetimetable[]
=== Merge Timetable Feature
==== Current Implementation
The merge feature allows for users to select multiple contacts and outputs a merged timetable with all
their common free slots. When the user inputs the indexes of the contacts he wants to merge, the `Person`(s) are stored
in an array , `personsToMerge`. The array is then iterated through, merging the all objects inside and
outputting a final `Person` to be added to the address book.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the merge mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user selects the indexes of the contacts he wants to merge and inputs a group name. `MergeCommandParser`
takes the indexes and puts it in a list. It then calls MergeCommand with the list and the group name as
arguments. The Merge Command uses the list of indexes and the `filteredPersonsList` to create and fill the array
`personsToMerge`. Your own contact, `Person` with "self" `Tag` is always added to the array.

image::MergeCommand1.PNG[width="350",align="center"]

Step 2. The `mergeTimetable` function is called on each `Person` in `personsToMerge` and the element after it. The merge
Timetable function iterates through all the time slots in both timetables and creates a new time table based on them.

image::MergeCommand4.PNG[width="500",align="center"]

Step 3. The `Name`s of each `Person` are appended together and gets saved in the `Address` of the merged
`Person`. The merged timetable and a "merged" `Tag` are added to the merged `Person`. The merged `Person` is also
given a placeholder `Email` and `Phone`. "merged" `Tag` causes these `Persons`(s) to be displayed in a separate list
in the UI.

image::MergeCommand3.PNG[width="450",align="center"]

Step 4. When `personsToMerge` is fully iterated through, the last
        `Person` inside is added to the address book. If there already exists a `Person` with the same `Name`, that
        `Person` is updated and a `CommandResult` reflecting this is shown.

image::MergeCommand5.PNG[width="350",align="center"]

The following sequence diagram shows how the `merge` function works.

image::MergeCommand6.PNG[width="500",align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How merge executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses a "merged" `Tag` to differentiate between merged and normal contacts. The
merged contacts are displayed in a separate part of the UI with the placeholder `Email` and `Phone` undisplayed.
`Address` is used to display the names of all the `Person`s merged together to create the merged `Person`.
** Pros: Easier to implement since it does not require creating a new Class.
** Cons: Violates SOC principles because now `Address` is used both to store addresses and names. This could lead to
potential bugs if `Address` is changed to have different requirements to be considered valid.
* **Alternative 2 (To be implemented in V2):** Have a specific Class that has timetable and name that is updated with
 the merged timetable and names of people being merged.
** Pros: Better follows Separation of Concerns Principle.
** Cons: Requires more time to implement.
// end::mergetimetable[]

// tag::updategrouptimetables[]
=== Update Groups Feature
==== Current Implementation
The update feature allows users to update all the timetables of the merged `Person` (s) that they have. It will
automatically update based on any changes to timetables or deletions of `Persons` (s) involved in the merge.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the merge mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user inputs update. A list of `Person`(s) with "merged" `Tag` is retrieved. The list is then iterated
through, updating each `Person` inside.

image::UpdateCommand1.PNG[width="400",align="center"]

Step 2. `Name` of the `Person` is saved as `groupName`. `Address` of the `Person` is tokenized and the names inside
are used find the `Person` with that name using the same mechanism as the `find` command. If a `Person` cannot be
found, the
`groupName` is stored in a map of `List` s,
`removedPersons` with name as they key. If it is found, it gets added to an array `personsToMerge`.

image::UpdateCommand2.PNG[width="500",align="center"]

Step 3. It then follows the same mechanism as the `merge` function to update the merged `Person`. If removedPersons
is not empty, it returns a `CommandResult` showing the `Person`(s) removed and the affected merged `Person`(s)

image::UpdateCommand3.PNG[width="500",align="center"]

The following sequence diagram shows how the `update` function works.

image::UpdateCommand4.PNG[width="500",align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How update executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Updates when called by the user and gets the people who are part of a merged
contact through their names at the time of merging.
** Pros: Faster as it only needs to process when feature is used.
** Cons: Could lead to contacts who still exist being left out during their update if their name has been edited.
* **Alternative 2 (To be implemented in V2):** Update every time there is a relevant change ie (editing a contact's
name, changing a contact's timetable or deleting a contact).
** Pros: More convenience for users. Prevents bug caused by editing a contact's name and then updating.
** Cons: A lot more processes involved which will slow down the application.
// end::updategrouptimetables[]

// tag::sortingofpersons[]
=== Sorting of contacts feature
==== Current Implementation

The sorting mechanism is implemented with `UniquePersonListHelper`, which is facilitated by `UniquePersonList`,
 which keeps a list of unique persons in `AddressBook`.
`UniquePersonListHelper` sorts the contacts in `UniquePersonList` in an lexicographical order, according
to the person's name. It implements the following operations:

Because `UniquePersonListHelper` stores persons in a treemap, with person name as the key, and person
as the value in the key-value pair of the treemap, it is able to automatically sort persons according
to their names.   Therefore, it is possible to iterate through `UniquePersonListHelper`,
in an in-order depth-first-search, to acquire the sorted order of persons.  This sorted order will be
copied into `UniquePersonList`.

* `UniquePersonList#add()` -- Adds a new person to `UniquePersonList`, and hence the contact list
* `UniquePersonList#remove()` -- Removes a new person to `UniquePersonList`, and hence the contact list
* `UniquePersonList#setPerson()` -- Sets a new person, in place of an existing person, to `UniquePersonList`, and hence the contact list
* `UniquePersonList#setPersons()` -- Sets a list of persons, in place of the current list of persons, to `UniquePersonList`, and hence the contact list
* `UniquePersonList#contains()` -- Checks if a person is already a part of `UniquePersonList`, and hence the contact list

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface, through `ModelManager`, then through `AddressBook`.
In `Model`, they are exposed as `Model#addPerson()`, `Model#deletePerson()`, `Model#updatePerson()`,
`Model#resetData()`, and `Model#hasPerson()` respectively.

Within `ModelManager`, the above listed operations are directly exposed as
`ModelManager#addPerson()`, `ModelManager#deletePerson()`, `ModelManager#updatePerson()`,
`ModelManager#resetData()`, and `ModelManager#hasPerson()` respectively.

Within `AddressBook`, the above listed operations are directly exposed as
`AddressBook#addPerson()`, `AddressBook#removePerson()`, `AddressBook#updatePerson()`,
`AddressBook#setPersons()`, and `AddressBook#hasPerson()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sorting mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `UniquePersonListHelper` will be initialized
 with the saved persons of the application. For this example, let us assume that the `UniquePersonList`
 is empty, and hence, there are no saved persons.

`UniquePersonList` will also be initialized, and will read inputs from `UniquePersonListHelper`.  Since
`UniquePersonListHelper` is empty, `UniquePersonList` will also be empty.  This is shown in the figure below.

image::SortedListStartingStateListAndTreeDiagram.png[width="500",align="center"]

Step 2. The user executes `add n/David ...` command, which calls `Model#addPerson()`, to add a new person.
The new person will be added to `UniquePersonListHelper`, and `UniquePersonList` will take reference from
`UniquePersonListHelper`.  This is shown in the figure below.

image::SortedListCommand1TreeStateDiagram.png[width="500",align="center"]

`UniquePersonListHelper` has the sorted order of person, and this sorted order will be copied into
 `UniquePersonList`.  This is shown in the figure below.

image::SortedListCommand1ListStateDiagram.png[width="500",align="center"]

The following sequence diagram shows how the `UniquePersonList` stays sorted when an `add` command is executed:

image::SortedListSequenceDiagramCommandAdd.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/Aaron ...`, which also calls `Model#addPerson()`, to add a new person.
Like step 2, the new person will be added to
`UniquePersonListHelper`.
This is shown in the figure below.

image::SortedListCommand2TreeStateDiagram.png[width="500",align="center"]

`UniquePersonList` will take reference from `UniquePersonListHelper`, as shown in the figure below.

image::SortedListCommand2ListStateDiagram.png[width="500",align="center"]

Step 4. The user executes `add n/Bella ...`, which also calls `Model#addPerson()`, to add a new person.
Because lexicographically, "B" comes before "D", person Bella, will be placed between Aaron and David.
`UniquePersonListHelper` stores persons in a treemap, and the red-black tree underlying data structure of
treemap, is able to handle this.   The new person will be added to `UniquePersonListHelper` in a sorted order,
 as shown in the figure below.

image::SortedListCommand3TreeStateDiagram.png[width="500",align="center"]

`UniquePersonList` will take reference from `UniquePersonListHelper`, as shown in the figure below.

image::SortedListCommand3ListStateDiagram.png[width="500",align="center"]

Step 5. The user now decides that adding the person Bella was a mistake.  Person Bella should not be in the `AddressBook`.
The user wishes to delete the person Bella, by executing the `delete 2` command.  This calls `Model#deletePerson()`.
  The `delete 2` command will check if Bella is a valid person, and if so, will delete the person Bella.

The red-black tree which is the underlying data structure of treemap, is able to handle this operation.  It simply
replaces the node it is about to delete, with the in-order successor.  More operations will be done to ensure a balanced
tree, within the underlying red-black tree.  This is shown in the figure below.

image::SortedListCommand5TreeStateDiagram.png[width="500",align="center"]

`UniquePersonList` will take reference from `UniquePersonListHelper`, as shown in the figure below.

image::SortedListCommand5ListStateDiagram.png[width="500",align="center"]

[NOTE]
If the Bella does not exist in `UniquePersonListHelper`,`UniquePersonListHelper` will return an error, and the
 `delete` command will not be executed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `UniquePersonList` stays sorted when an `delete` command is executed:
It is very similar to that of the `add` command.

image::SortedListSequenceDiagramCommandDelete.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as
`list`, will usually not call `Model#addPerson()`, `Model#deletePerson()`, `Model#updatePerson()`, `Model#resetData()`,
or `Model#hasPerson()`.  Thus the state of `UniquePersonListHelper` will remain unchanged.  This is shown in the figure
below.

image::SortedListCommand6TreeStateDiagram.png[width="500",align="center"]

Therefore, `UniquePersonList` will also remain unchanged, as shown in the figure below.

image::SortedListCommand6ListStateDiagram.png[width="500",align="center"]

Step 7. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#resetData()`.  This replaces all data in the address book with an
empty address book.  Hence, `UniquePersonListHelper` will be cleared of all persons.  This is shown in the figure below.

image::SortedListCommand7TreeStateDiagram.png[width="500",align="center"]

Therefore, `UniquePersonList` will also be cleared of all persons, as shown in the figure below.

image::SortedListCommand7ListStateDiagram.png[width="500",align="center"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::SortedListActivityDiagram.png[width="400",align="center"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the list is sorted

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a helper class, UniquePersonListHelper, which uses a treemap to sort the names.
Clears the UniquePersonList every time a change is made, and iterates through the UniquePersonListHelper, to build a new
 UniquePersonList.
** Pros: Easy to implement.  Allows for minimal and compartmentalised changes throughout the code base.  Fast overall
time complexity of O(N).
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** implement a comparator in the current UniquePersonList.
** Pros: Will use less memory, because there is no need for a helping class or data structure.
** Cons: It has a time complexity of O(N log N), which is slower than our chosen implementation.

===== Aspect: Defensive programming practices for helper class

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement all checks for errors in the helper class, `UniquePersonListHelper` and none in
`UniquePersonList`.  This is because the helper class is in charge of the actual execution of the program.  If the checks for
errors are implemented in `UniquePersonList` only, it is possible for a new developer to accidentally bypass the checks.
** Pros: Prevents unnecessary checks and hence, potentially confusing code.
** Cons: If any changes are made to the helper class in the future, e.g. removing the helper class, the developer has
to remember to implement his/her own checks.
* **Alternative 2:** Implement all checks for errors in both `UniquePersonList` and `UniquePersonListHelper`.
** Pros: This would add an additional layer of defence to possible careless mistakes by developers in the future.  E.g.
If they were to make their own version of the helper class but forget to implement their own checks for errors, `UniquePersonList`
would still have backup checks.
** Cons: Introducing redundant checks, which would be misleading, This makes code harder to understand.
  Redundant checks might also incorrectly encourage careless programing habits.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::downloadCommands[]

=== Download Commands
Both `downloadSelectNotes` and `downloadAllNotes` extends on the  `downloadAbstract` class which itself extends from the
`command` class. The implementation is similar up till the downloading segment. The download
commands uses _Selenium Chromedrivers_ to initiate downloads from the internet.

The following class diagram shows the relationship of `downloadAllNotes`,`downloadSelectNotes` as well as
`downloadAbstract`.

image::DownloadClassDiagram.png[width="550",align="center"]
****
[NOTE]
The download function has temporarily been disabled in accordance with NUS Information Technology Acceptable use policy for IT resources Ver4.2, Clause 4.6

However, if desired, the function can be manually enabled by changing the state of `isDownloadDisabled` in `DownloadAbstract.java`.
****

==== DownloadAllNotes command

The following Sequence diagram shows how `downloadAllNotes` is handled.

image::downloadAllNotesSequence.png[width="450",align="center"]

Format: `downloadAllNotes downloadAllNotes [user/IVLE USERNAME] [pass/IVLE PASSWORD] [mod/ENROLLED MODULE]`

===== Current Implementation
Step 1: Extract files from Jar. Since _Selenium ChromeDriver_ requires it to be present
in the directory as an executable inorder to be ran, it would need to be extracted from  NSync.jar before carrying on. Additionally, a _Notes_ folder would be created
to store the notes downloaded.

Step 2: Set the `webdriver.chrome.driver` system variable to the location of the ChromeDriver executable. This step is necessary.

Step 3: Set the download path and other settings for _ChromeDriver_.
[NOTE]
Headless mode for _ChromeDriver_ has been disabled due to security reasons, an alternative is to start _ChromeDriver_ in an unviewable location on the screen to prevent disrupting the users interactions.

Step 4: Login into _IVLE_ , and check if successful. If not, a `CommandExeption` will be thrown
to alert the user that either `IVLE USERNAME` or `IVLE PASSWORD` is incorrect.

Step 5: If user is logged in, check if the `ENROLLED MODULE` exists. If not, a `CommandException` will
be thrown to alert the user that the `ENROLLED MODULE` specified does not exist.

Step 6: Navigate to the _IVLE download page_, select all files and download as .zip file.

[NOTE]
While Downloading, the program would introduce "busy waiting" to prevent the _ChromeDriver_ from terminating before the download is complete.

Step 7: Unzip the files and store it in a folder created based on the name of `ENROLLED MODULE` inside the _Notes_ folder created at `Step 1`.


==== DownloadSelectNotes Command

The following Sequence diagram shows how `downloadAllNotes` is handled.

image::downloadSelectNotesSequence.png[width="550",align="center"]

Format: `downloadSelectNotes [user/IVLE USERNAME] [pass/IVLE PASSWORD] [mod/ENROLLED MODULE] [file/FILE INDEXES: 1,2,3...n]`

[NOTE]
The existance of the `file/` prefix is optional, and the existance of this prefix will affect the execution

==== Current Implementation

Step 1-5: is exactly the same as `DownloadAllNotes` command.

Step 6a: If user has **NOT** entered a `file/` prefix, the program will fetch all available file names and store it in a formatted string; A _static_ `FILE INDEX` will be appended to the front of the file name. The formatted string is returned as a `CommandResult`.

Step 6b: If user has entered a `file/` prefix. The program will download files according to the `FILE INDEXES` supplied. It is stored in the _Notes_ folder created at `Step 1`.

[NOTE]
If an incorrect file index has been supplied, download will stop after encountering an invalid index. Example: `file/1,2,9000,3` if 1,2,3 are valid file indexes, only file 1,2 will be downloaded.

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect 1: Which Driver is used
**Implementation 1 (Current Implementation)**

Currently `downloadNotes` uses _ChromeDriver_ to initiate its downloads. It provides capabilities for navigating to web pages, user input, JavaScript execution, and more.

The user would be required to have _Google Chrome_ installed inorder to use this function

Pros: Google Chrome is one of the most widely used browsers in the world. Thus statistically speaking, most NUS users would already have _Google Chrome_ installed.

Cons: _Google Chrome_ is extremely ram intensive, and the function would fail to cater to users who do not use Google Chrome.

**Implementation 2(HTML unitdriver)**

HTML UnitDriver is the most light weight, natively headless and the fastest implementation of WebDriver.

Pros: Its extremely fast, does not require prior installation of any other applications to function.

Cons: It uses a javaScript engine called _Rhino_. This engine is incompatible with _IVLE_'s usage of javaScript. Making it unable to navigate past `Step 5`.

===== Aspect 2: How notes are downloaded
** Implementation 1 (Current Implementation)**

As mentioned previously, currently `downloadNotes` uses _ChromeDriver_ to initiate its downloads.

Pros: The current implementation navigates through the _IVLE_ Web page to download the files "Pseudo" manually. Thus we could be easily morph this implementation to suit other platforms and websites. Its also easy to update.

    example: NTU web portal

Cons: It requires user to have _Google Chrome_ installed.

**Implementation 2 (IVLE API)**

An alternative implementation is to use the existing IVLE API to instantiate the downloads.

Pros: Its supported by _NUS_, and thus should be more reliable than the _IVLE_ platform.

Cons: The existing IVLE API is outdated, many parts are not functional as of 10-11-2018. Furthermore, IVLE is migrating to luminous as of 2019, thus if implemented with IVLE API, it would require a ground up rebuild to keep the function operational.
// end::downloadCommands[]

// tag::showNotesCommand[]

=== ShowNotes Command
ShowNotes recursively searches the `Notes` folder created by `DownloadNotes` Command.

==== Current Implementation
A static String is used to store all the information `notesResult`.

The files are differentiated by 2 catagories: Directories and Others. If `currentFile` is a directory, a recursive call will be made and the directory name appended with _N_ tabs would be added to `notesResult` , else, just the file name and _N_ tabs would be apprended and added to ` notesResult`.

[NOTE]
_N_ refers to the number of recursive calls made up till the point of arriving at `currentFile`.

==== Design Considerations
The Current implementation is the most efficient way to list out all the files in a directory. An Iterative method could have been used. However due to the fact that the relative "depth" of a directory is unknown. It would be rather counter-intuitive to search iteratively.

// end::showNotesCommand[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

=== Deleting downloaded notes

Because features which involve downloading notes have been disallowed by NUS, in order to test deleting notes,
testers have to manually create notes and delete them.  However, because this is not how NSync was designed to work,
testers have to restart NSync every time they manually create and delete notes within NSync, in order for NSync to
behave correctly.

. Deleting selected notes

.. Prerequisites: Before starting NSync, go to the directory the .jar file is in.  Create a directory titled "notes".
    Within the newly created
    "notes" directory, create 5 separate directories titled "CS2101", "CS2113", "GEQ1000", "GER1000", "ST2334".
     It is up to the tester if he wants to create documents or subdirectories within any of the newly created 5
     directories, in order to simulate actual notes being stored within the directories.
.. Test case: `deleteSelectNotes ST2334` +
   Expected: The directory "ST2334" and its contents are deleted from the "notes" directory.
    "ST2334" will be shown in the first line of the status message, which shows the notes that have been deleted.
    In the second line of the status message, which shows the entries that are invalid, it will not contain any elements,
    as "ST2334" is a valid entry. +
    Timestamp in the status bar is not updated, as this command does
    not modify the addressBook.
.. Test case: `deleteSelectNotes ger1000 geq1000` +
   Expected: No notes are deleted.
    Expected: No notes are deleted.  Error details suggesting for the user to run `showNotes` is displayed. Timestamp
   in the status bar is not updated.  This is because only invalid entries are entered, and the entries are case-sensitive.
    Timestamp in the status bar is not updated, as this command does
    not modify the addressBook portion of NSync.
.. Test case: `deleteSelectNotes GER1000 GEQ1000` +
   Expected: The directories "GER1000" and "GEQ1000" and their contents are deleted from the "notes" directory.
    "GEQ1000" and "GER1000" will be shown in the first line of the status message, which shows the notes that
    have been deleted.
    In the second line of the status message, which shows the entries that are invalid, it will not contain any elements,
    as "GEQ1000" and "GER1000" are valid entries. +
    Timestamp in the status bar is not updated, as this command does
    not modify the addressBook portion of NSync.
.. Test case: `deleteSelectNotes CS ST2334` +
   Expected: The directories "CS2101" and "CS2113" and their contents are deleted from the "notes" directory.
    "CS2101" and "CS2113" will be shown in the first line of the status message, which shows the notes that
    have been deleted.
    In the second line of the status message, which shows the entries that are invalid, "ST2334" will be shown.
    This is because "ST2334" has been previously deleted and should no longer exist in the NSync.+
    Timestamp in the status bar is not updated, as this command does
    not modify the addressBook portion of NSync.
.. Test case: `deleteSelectNotes CS ST2334` +
   Expected: No notes are deleted.  Error details suggesting for the user to run `showNotes` is displayed. Timestamp
   in the status bar is not updated.  This is because only invalid entries are entered.
.. Test case: `deleteSelectNotes` +
   Expected: No notes are deleted.  Error details are shown in the status message.  Timestamp remains unchanged.

. Clearing notes

.. Prerequisites: Before starting NSync, go to the directory the .jar file is in.  Create a directory titled "notes".
    Within the newly created
    "notes" directory, create 5 separate directories titled "CS2101", "CS2113", "GEQ1000", "GER1000", "ST2334".
     It is up to the tester if he wants to create documents or subdirectories within any of the newly created 5
     directories, in order to simulate actual notes being stored within the directories.
.. Test case: `clearNotes` +
   Expected: All files and directories in the "notes" folder will be cleared.  This only excludes hidden bookkeeping files
     created by the user's operating system.  The resultant "notes" folder will be
   empty.  The status message indicating that your notes have been cleared will be shown.  Timestamp in the status bar
   is not updated, as this command does not modify the addressBook portion of NSync.
.. Test case: `clearNotes` +
   Expected: Even though the "notes" folder is empty, clearNotes will still run to ensure that it is indeed empty.
   Timestamp in the status bar is not updated, as this command does not modify the addressBook portion of NSync.

[NOTE]
Both `deleteAllNotes` and `clearNotes` commands are designed to work with `downloadAllNotes` and `downloadSelectNotes`
commands.  Using the download commands, notes will be downloaded into the "notes" directory, and automatically, neatly
stored in a subdirectory within the "notes" directory.  The name of the subdirectory is the typical module codes of
modules in NUS. This is made possible by the API used for the download notes commands, as well as the module code parser
built into NSync.  The result is that all names of subdirectories will be the module code only e.g. "CS2100" and not
"CS2100 Introduction to Computer Organisation".


=== Download Commands

[NOTE]
The download function has temporarily been disabled in accordance with NUS Information Technology Acceptable use policy for IT resources Ver4.2, Clause 4.6

However, if desired, the function can be manually enabled by changing the state of `isDownloadDisabled` in `DownloadAbstract.java`.

=== ShowNotes Command

Since the download function has been disabled, testers can create a `notes` folder in the directory of the jar file and fill it with items. The ShowNotes command will display it accordingly


=== Changing a person's time slot

. Deleting a person while all persons are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list. Ensure the 1st contact
does not have GER1000 at the monday 10am slot of his timetable.
.. Test case: `change 1 mon 10am GER1000` +
   Expected: First contact's monday 10am time slot is changed to GER1000. A messaeg indicating the change has
   happened successfully is shown. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `change 0 mon 10am GER1000` +
   Expected: No change happens. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `change 1 ada 10am GER1000`, `change 1 mon 2321am GER1000`, `change 1 mon
10am GER1000` when the first person's monday 10am slot already has GER1000.

   Expected: Invalid Day, Invalid Time, No time slot changed respectively.
